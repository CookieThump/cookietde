[TL;DR](/TLDR)

I have been fascinated by IT security since I was a teenager and started studying computer science right after graduating from high school. During my computer science studies, I initially focused first partially in my bachelor's degree, and then mainly in my master's degree on offensive IT security. Furthermore, I always enjoyed hacking in my free time.

After completing my studies, I worked as a security engineer for a software company and IT service provider for tax products for 2.5 years. I supervised several development teams, with a focus on patching security vulnerabilities and license management. I was also responsible for the planning, preparation, and follow-up of penetration tests, as well as the processing and incorporation of the results.

By attending various security conferences in my free time (BlackHat 22, Defcon 31, 37C3, Defcon 32), I was able to give various lectures at work on the topic of current security vulnerabilities and how to avoid them. The largest lecture I gave was heard by 850 people.

I have repeatedly participated in various competitions and CTFs. A recent highlight was holding my first own contest ([CPS DART](https://forum.defcon.org/node/249396)) at Defcon 32 and taking second place in the Red Team Village [Red Team Rumble](https://redteamvillage.io/rtr.html) at Defcon 32 with my team "Chasse Partie".

After a period of self-reflection at my first Defcon, I realized that I had slipped too much into the Blue Team side of my job and wanted to turn my passion for the Red Team into more of a career again. So, I decided that I wanted to become a penetration tester.

However, starting a career as a penetration tester without OSCP and without professional experience is not easy. That's why I left my former job in July 2024 to complete the OSCP on my own. The final exam of the course will be in mid-January. So, from February 1, 2025, I would like to get back into the professional world and finally turn my passion into a career.
